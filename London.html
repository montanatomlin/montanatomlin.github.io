			<h3>Shopping and Sightseeing in London</h3>
			  <p class="sat-after">Big Ben is the first place I visited.Big Ben is a tower clock known for its accuracy and for its massive hour bell. Strictly speaking, the name refers only to the bell, which weighs 15.1 tons (13.7 metric tons), but it is commonly associated with the whole clock tower at the northern end of the Houses of Parliament, in the London borough of Westminster.Lastly, I went to Oxford Street which is a popular shopping street in the West End of London. It is one of London's best-known streets, containing a plethora  of famous department stores  as well as the high-street shops.</p>
